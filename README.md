# Successes

# Application requirements

<li>If the Employer clicks one of the links in the navigation
then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section</li>
<li>Employer is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them</li>
<li>If the Employer clicks on the link to the section about their work then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications</li>
<li>When the Employer is presented with the developer's first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others</li>
<li>When the Employer clicks on the images of the applications
then the Employer is taken to that deployed application</li>
<li>When the Employer resizes the page or view the site on various screens and devices then the Employer is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport</li>
